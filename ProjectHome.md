# APG #
Manage OpenPGP keys on your phone, use them to encrypt, sign, decrypt emails and files.

## Goals ##
Hopefully APG can grow into a fully featured equivalent of GPG on Android phones, allowing easy and secure management of keys and trust thereof, as well as being useful to other apps via Intents or even some other API. The main goal is to get some decent integration with k9mail.
